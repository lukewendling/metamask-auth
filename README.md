# Wallet auth demo app

### Dependencies

* Node 8+

### Install

Start API server and UI:

```
npm i
npm start
npm run dev
google-chrome http://localhost:3000/login
```

### Dev notes

* The UI is a Next.js app, for HMR reloading and Babel integration. Some pages might be slow to load on first visit while Next compiles the page. Not a big fan of Next but it's ok for small apps.
